<!-- Short summary or background information -->

creating a node and linkedlist project which i lost the purpose of
because all i did was wade through very poor instruction

## Challenge

reading the instructions, trying to divine with tea leaves what the hell was expected of me

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

i used the approach we were shown, i made a node, i made a list. pretty sure space is a constant and time is linear
