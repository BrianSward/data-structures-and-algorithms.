# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
## Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

### set
- Arguments: key, value
- Returns: nothing
- This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed. Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the value argument given to this method.

### get
- Arguments: key
- Returns: Value associated with that key in the table has
Arguments: key
- Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

### keys
- Returns: Collection of keys

### _hash
- Arguments: key
- Returns: Index in the collection for that key

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a class that does the above and tests for them

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
pretty sure i managed o(n) for space, and o(1) for time as was discussed with us in class and reinforced in our readings

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your hashtable -->
