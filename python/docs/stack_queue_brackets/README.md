## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
i chose to save my opening brackets in a bucket, seeing if the closing brackets align with their opening cousins,
if so removing them as needed and returning logic appro. the situation
