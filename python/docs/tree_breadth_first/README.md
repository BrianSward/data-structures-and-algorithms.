# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Write a function called breadth first
Arguments: tree
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

i think the space will be O(n) where n is the number of nodes in our tree as we will have to stop everywhere
i think the time will also be O(n) for the same reason above

## Solution
