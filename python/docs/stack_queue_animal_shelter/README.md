# Challenge Summary
<!-- Description of the challenge -->

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

Feature Tasks
Create a class called AnimalShelter which holds only dogs and cats.
The shelter operates using a first-in, first-out approach.
Implement the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: animal
animal can be either a dog or a cat object.
dequeue
Arguments: pref
pref can be either "dog" or "cat"
Return: either a dog or a cat, based on preference.
If pref is not "dog" or "cat" then return null.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

For Time: Popping and Enqueuing is O(1) as those two processes are constant
For Space: O(N) I think as the length of the queues inside the animal shelters grows, so will the space to save it as longer list
will consume more space

i dont have any code. but im submitting this now so i can get more points later if i dont quit due to
zero help.

for yet again i wrote code, because there was nothing mentioning having for classes of dog
and cat so i wasted 4 hours of my time going down a dead end and listening to people lecture me about my attitude.
Someone i don't need as I have been asking for help for two weeks and have received next to none for code challenges
regardless of how many times i ask and how many people. instead i get people telling me, "yah you complained about this
before" awesome feeling when you are confused and ask people honest questions and get told you have too many feels and
yuo already complained about it. wow great feels
